### Natours Sass Project



<!--This is a project I coded following the course made by Jonas Schmedtmann which is the design owner of Natours, you can check it out his course in Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/).

At the moment I'm learning and remembering some principles of CSS, but also getting, at the first time, my hands in Sass which I'm really liking and wanting to take forward on my projects.

The current website is made of a float based grid, which is currently kind of outdated but still has a lot of offer. From now on, I'm aiming to master flex and grid but it was really cool to build your own grid and use some media queries to make it all right.

Hope you like it!-->
